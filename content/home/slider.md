Only a fraction of cancer patients respond to immunotherapies. We participate to several randomized clinical trials that use transcriptomic or in situ biomarkers of the TME to select the metastatic cancer patients before treatment, in order to validate our hypotheses and enrich patients response to immunotherapies."
